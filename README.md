# Mission-to-Mars

This project utilized BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of the images from the [Mars Hemisphere Website](https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars/ "Named link title"). I stored the scraped data on a Mongo database and used a web application to display the data. I then altered the design of the web app to accommodate these images using Bootstrap 3.
